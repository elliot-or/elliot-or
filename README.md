## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**elliot-or/elliot-or** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Lets start with the basics, I have no clue what I am doing. I am a designer, fabricator, architectural designer with zero coding or dev experience. I am here to twiddle my thumbs and maybe learn something new or two. 
I have ideas for potential products, apps, websites, and hope to utilize AI to write a majority of code. Sounds risky. I think there is an oportunity to learn from the AI and develope my own dev crtitical thinking skills. 
I do not know if anything will come from this, I have more questions than answers but I am excited to jump into the deep end.
